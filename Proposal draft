Title: Exploring comorbid depression and high blood pressure association to the gut microbiome taxa and functionality: 
An In-depth functional analysis of the gut microbiome taxonomy

Introduction & Background: Depression and hypertension are prevalent chronic conditions worldwide, each contributing 
substantially to global disease burden and mortality. Depression is estimated to affect over 300 million people (1), while hypertension affects 
more than 1.4 billion adults (2). Despite one condition being psychiatric and the other cardiovascular, the relationship between depression and 
hypertension has been studied extensively over the last century. Depression affects about 26% of hypertensive patients worldwide (9).

Recently, depression has been identified as a potential risk factor for the development of high blood pressure with numerous clinical reports 
demonstrating an increased risk for hypertension in depressed patients (6,7). Researchers have hypothesized that depression may lead to cardiovascular 
dysregulation through inflammatory, metabolic, and neuroendocrinal pathways (3). Furthermore, both conditions have also been linked to alterations in the 
gut microbiome. Hypertension has been associated with reduced gut microbial diversity along with altered composition and functionality in both mouse models 
and humans (8). Specific microbiome compositions and the ability to induce depressive behaviors in mice has also been identified (4).

Research by Bruce. R has established how patients with both depression and hypertension possess a microbiota with co-occurrence of several bacteria 
with Streptococcus salivarium, in which the composition is associated with sodium absorption and inflammasome induction (5). It has also been found 
that this ecology is distinct from patients with depression or hypertension alone (5). However, in depth analysis of the functionality of each distinct 
bacteria, rather than it's assosiation to a collective phenomenon, could be explored furthur in each of the  4 cohorts (patients with both disorders,
patients with either one, or neither). This project aims to explore the interlinkage of depression and hypertension in depth, and it’s influence on the 
functionality of the gut microbiota.

Research Objective and Hypothesis:
Research Question: How does the microbiome functionality differ across patients with high blood pressure, clinical depression, 
and cormorbid conditions? 
Prediction:

Experimental Aims and Rationale:
1) Determine how microbial diversity and abudance of specific species differs between the 4 cohorts.
2) Conduct functional analyses on bacterial species of interest and determine how they are linked with altered metabolite production and pathways.
